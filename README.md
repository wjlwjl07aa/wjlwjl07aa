wjlwjl07aa README

- 🏴 I’m currently working on ... being retired, coding for fun, enjoying a Bohemian lifestyle.
- 🏴 I’m currently learning ... React, GitHub, NodeJs, JavaScript
- 🏴 The facts: Seventeen wonderful years as mediocre coder. Thirteen soul-destroying years in Management and Enterprise Architecture. Ten years of bad behavior and big trouble ... was better than being a bourgeois IT Director.  
- 🏴 Fun fact: Two years of bliss get paid for hacking Common LSIP on a Symobolic 3640. 
- 🐈‍⬛ Pronouns: HE, HIM, OG
